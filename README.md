# HaulyLab...
...is inspired by patternlab.io. It have almost the same function.

##Customize
You can customize this function/settings:

- Menu
-- You're free to choice the default menu that generated by php or use the menu.json in core/navigation/ to setup your navigation.

- Breakpoints
-- You can set youre breakpoints.

## How to use
HaulyLab need grunt, php, javascript. I let HaulyLab run on a default XAMPP installation. 

### Install
Clone the repository and go in this file with your command line and start npm install this should all download all things that you need. After this step type grunt and start with your work.

#### Structure
If you use the default navigation, then the structure have to be like:
patterns/atoms/atom/file

I use here php files, because I will include my atoms.

### Assets
Youre assets should be in the assets directory. Feel free to change the structure in this assets and check the gruntfile. ;)

### Add php-function
Go in the core there you find the functions.php in this file will all things required that you need. For an own function make a new directory and then wrote your function. At last step requiere this in the functions.php
